# Elements Invaders üöÄ

**Elements Invaders** is a modern, fast-paced, 3D space shooter game built from the ground up with a professional tech stack including React, Three.js, and a dedicated physics engine. This project was developed as a comprehensive exercise in building a complete game loop, managing complex state, and optimizing performance in a web-based 3D environment.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Physics-Based Gameplay**: Utilizes the **Rapier** physics engine for realistic and satisfying collision detection and object interactions.
- **Advanced State Management**: All game logic, from player health to enemy waves, is centrally managed using **Redux Toolkit**, ensuring a predictable and scalable state architecture.
- **Clean, Hook-Based Architecture**: Complex logic for player controls, enemy AI, power-ups, and collisions is encapsulated into reusable **Custom Hooks**, keeping UI components clean and declarative.
- **Dynamic UI & HUD**: Features a complete Heads-Up Display (HUD) for health, weapon heat, ammo, and more, rendered as an HTML overlay for maximum performance and clarity.
- **Multiple Weapon Systems**: Includes a primary rapid-fire weapon with an overheat/cooldown mechanic and a limited-use, high-damage secondary weapon (Blaster).
- **Power-Up & Leveling System**: Enemies drop random power-ups (health, ammo, weapon upgrades) based on a kill-count threshold, and the game features a multi-level progression system.
- **Immersive 3D Environment**: The scene is brought to life with dynamic particle effects for stars, planetary rings, and spaceship engine trails.

##  performance-considerations-section Performance Considerations

This project utilizes high-fidelity 3D models to deliver a rich visual experience. The total asset payload is approximately 12-13MB, a deliberate trade-off to achieve the desired visual quality, which is common for immersive WebGL experiences.

To ensure a smooth user experience, a **two-stage loading system** has been implemented:
1.  An **initial static loader** provides instant feedback while the main application bundle loads.
2.  A secondary loader, built with React's `<Suspense>`, then manages the loading of all 3D models and assets, ensuring a seamless entry into the game.
